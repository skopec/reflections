How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

If one of the files has a bug and the other hasn't, then the bug is one of the differencies 
between this files. Diff shows us all differencies between files, so that we are not to search 
them manually in similar files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

God knows.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro: Each commit can be somehow logically complete and runable code.
Con: If I forget to commit, there will be no commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Google Docs is to be used with documents, where each file is separate and has no strong relationship to others.
Git is intended to use for programming, where one program typically consist of many files related to each other.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can easily find where the buggy change comes from.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For my Arduino program codes.
